# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? 1
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? Totally unproductive. I felt super lost, spent hours googling online.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I need more than practice, I need actual guidance.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I have no idea what I'm doing with for statements
